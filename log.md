## [2026-05-23] create | AI Agency Knowledgebase initialized
- Created Markdown/Git wiki structure for Superagency-style AI agency research.
- Seeded core idea, domain, argument, use-case, source-library, framework, and open-question pages.

## [2026-05-23] update | Knowledgebase tool comparison seeded
- Expanded [[Knowledgebase Tool Comparison]] with initial architecture recommendation, app tradeoffs, RAG/search options, and contrarian risks.
- Current default: keep Markdown/Git as source of truth; add Wiki.js, Obsidian/Logseq, or lightweight semantic search only when the pain justifies the service.

## [2026-05-24] update | First display-mode daily digest and source seeding
- Created [[Daily AI Agency Digest — 2026-05-24]].
- Added 12 accepted source records to `/sources/sources.jsonl`.
- Created durable pages [[Agentic Workflow Patterns]], [[AI as Normal Technology]], [[Co-Intelligence]], [[The Turing Trap]], [[Task-Level AI Adoption]], [[AI Tutor Evaluation Checklist]], and [[Compute and Agency]].
- Updated [[AI as Copilot]], [[Responsible Deployment]], [[Superagency]], [[Education]], [[Work]], [[Home Server AI Agents]], [[Strongest AI Risk Arguments]], [[AI Tutors]], and [[Balanced Governance]].
- Updated source libraries [[Articles]], [[Books]], [[Papers]], and [[Reports]].
- Added latest-run navigation to [[AI Agency Knowledgebase]].

## [2026-05-24] lint | Sunday maintenance check
- Checked duplicate page names, broken wikilinks, orphan pages, tag taxonomy, JSONL validity, and page size.
- Result after fixes: 0 broken wikilinks, 0 orphan content pages, 0 invalid tags, valid `/sources/sources.jsonl`.
- Known benign duplicate: root `README.md` and `raw/README.md` share the same filename but serve different folder scopes.
- `blogwatcher-cli` was unavailable in the runtime, so feed-based scanning was skipped; web/source discovery proceeded through direct web checks and curated source verification.

## [2026-05-24] update | Expanded daily digest with field-evidence and frontier-firm sources
- Added 12 accepted source records to `/sources/sources.jsonl` after direct web/PDF verification.
- Created [[Frontier Firm]] and [[AI Field Experiment Evidence]].
- Updated [[Work]], [[Future of Work]], [[Education]], [[AI Coding Agents]], [[Agentic Workflow Patterns]], and [[AI Use Case Evaluation Rubric]] with field-study, tutoring, coding-agent, and workflow evidence.
- Updated [[Reports]], [[Papers]], [[Articles]], [[Home]], and [[Daily AI Agency Digest — 2026-05-24]].
- Research scout subagents timed out during web discovery; manual direct search and URL verification completed the source pass.

## [2026-05-27] update | Daily AI curator run
- Created [[Daily AI Agency Digest — 2026-05-27]] anchored on Pope Leo XIV's *Magnifica Humanitas*, Vatican-Anthropic alliance, Claude Code & OpenClaw agent revolution, and Agentic Business Transformation framework.
- Added 6 accepted source records to `/sources/sources.jsonl` from WIRED, MIT Technology Review, Stratechery, and Vatican primary sources.
- Created [[Magnifica Humanitas]], [[AI Agent Revolution]], and [[Agentic Business Transformation]].
- Updated [[Superagency]], [[AI as Copilot]], [[AI and Human Flourishing]], [[Balanced Governance]], [[Work]], and [[Home Server AI Agents]].
- Updated [[AI Agency Knowledgebase]] navigation with new digest and pages.
- Noted: WIRED RSS feed provided the primary source discovery path; Stratechery content was paywalled but meta description captured the thesis; arXiv and NYT were JS-rendered and not accessible via curl.

## [2026-05-26] update | Daily AI curator pass 2
- Created [[Daily AI Agency Digest — 2026-05-26 (Pass 2)]], complementary to the earlier May 26 digest.
- Added 12 accepted source records to `/sources/sources.jsonl` from arXiv (cs.CY, cs.HC) RSS feeds.
- Created [[AI-Augmented Scientific Collaboration]] as a new use-case page anchored on the global scientific-feedback RCT.
- Updated [[Education]] — added correct-answer-trap evidence, Restrict/Scaffold/Require assessment governance framework, European student AI literacy data.
- Updated [[Work]] — added M365 Copilot enterprise usage data (5.5M sessions), HARMONY R&D operating model, AI productivity moderating factors.
- Updated [[AI as Copilot]] — added AI-as-equalizer-vs-amplifier framework, reasoning-traces-as-interface-artifacts study, collaborative writing design findings.
- Updated [[Creativity]] — seeded with collaborative writing study, reasoning traces findings, batch-mode interaction recommendations.
- Updated [[Government and Civic Life]] — seeded with Habermolt AI-delegated deliberation paradigm and decentralization governance vacuum analysis.
- Updated [[Balanced Governance]] — added metacognition-as-governance framework, Restrict/Scaffold/Require education stances, decentralization governance challenges.
- Updated [[AI and Human Flourishing]] — seeded with scientific collaboration RCT, AI-equalizer/amplifier reconciliation, student literacy crisis data.
- Updated [[AI Agency Knowledgebase]] navigation with new digest link.
- Noted: blogwatcher-cli unavailable; web-based arXiv RSS discovery completed the source pass.
- Created [[Daily AI Agency Digest — 2026-05-26]].
- Added 8 accepted source records to `/sources/sources.jsonl` after direct web verification.
- Created [[Agentic Convergence Trap]] as a new core idea page.
- Updated [[Work]] — added MIT Tech Review labor data, HBR manager bottleneck, and manufacturing augmentation patterns.
- Updated [[AI Coding Agents]] — added Nolan Lawson slow-quality coding approach and multi-model review technique.
- Updated [[Human Agency]] — added evidence-based transition framing, data infrastructure needs, and agentic convergence as agency-loss risk.
- Updated [[Agentic Workflow Patterns]] — added multi-model independent review pattern and manager-of-managers workflow.
- Updated [[Balanced Governance]] — added Stanford AI Index 2026 responsible-AI gap data and agentic convergence governance needs.
- Updated [[Optimism Without Naivety]] — added data-driven labor market framing, Stanford jagged frontier, and Doctorow bubble perspective.
- Updated [[AI Agency Knowledgebase]] navigation.
- Noted: `blogwatcher-cli` was not available in the runtime; web-based source discovery via direct URL fetching completed the source pass.
- Created [[Daily AI Agency Digest — 2026-05-25]].
- Added 14 accepted source records to `/sources/sources.jsonl` after direct web/PDF verification; `blogwatcher-cli` was unavailable, so feed scanning was skipped.
- Created [[Positive Alignment]] and [[Human Review Checkpoints]].
- Updated [[Human Agency]], [[Responsible Deployment]], [[Education]], [[Work]], [[AI for School Districts]], [[Agentic Workflow Patterns]], [[Balanced Governance]], and [[Strongest AI Risk Arguments]].
- Updated source libraries [[Articles]], [[Papers]], [[Reports]], and navigation in [[AI Agency Knowledgebase]].
- Noted access issues for some candidate pages (for example McKinsey/ScienceDirect/Medium); skipped inaccessible candidates unless enough verified metadata/content was available elsewhere.
