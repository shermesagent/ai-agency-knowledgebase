## [2026-05-23] create | AI Agency Knowledgebase initialized
- Created Markdown/Git wiki structure for Superagency-style AI agency research.
- Seeded core idea, domain, argument, use-case, source-library, framework, and open-question pages.

## [2026-05-23] update | Knowledgebase tool comparison seeded
- Expanded [[Knowledgebase Tool Comparison]] with initial architecture recommendation, app tradeoffs, RAG/search options, and contrarian risks.
- Current default: keep Markdown/Git as source of truth; add Wiki.js, Obsidian/Logseq, or lightweight semantic search only when the pain justifies the service.

## [2026-05-24] update | First display-mode daily digest and source seeding
- Created [[Daily AI Agency Digest — 2026-05-24]].
- Added 12 accepted source records to `/sources/sources.jsonl`.
- Created durable pages [[Agentic Workflow Patterns]], [[AI as Normal Technology]], [[Co-Intelligence]], [[The Turing Trap]], [[Task-Level AI Adoption]], [[AI Tutor Evaluation Checklist]], and [[Compute and Agency]].
- Updated [[AI as Copilot]], [[Responsible Deployment]], [[Superagency]], [[Education]], [[Work]], [[Home Server AI Agents]], [[Strongest AI Risk Arguments]], [[AI Tutors]], and [[Balanced Governance]].
- Updated source libraries [[Articles]], [[Books]], [[Papers]], and [[Reports]].
- Added latest-run navigation to [[AI Agency Knowledgebase]].

## [2026-05-24] lint | Sunday maintenance check
- Checked duplicate page names, broken wikilinks, orphan pages, tag taxonomy, JSONL validity, and page size.
- Result after fixes: 0 broken wikilinks, 0 orphan content pages, 0 invalid tags, valid `/sources/sources.jsonl`.
- Known benign duplicate: root `README.md` and `raw/README.md` share the same filename but serve different folder scopes.
- `blogwatcher-cli` was unavailable in the runtime, so feed-based scanning was skipped; web/source discovery proceeded through direct web checks and curated source verification.
