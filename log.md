- Expanded [[Knowledgebase Tool Comparison]] with initial architecture recommendation, app tradeoffs, RAG/search options, and contrarian risks.
- Current default: keep Markdown/Git as source of truth; add Wiki.js, Obsidian/Logseq, or lightweight semantic search only when the pain justifies the service.

## [2026-05-24] update | First display-mode daily digest and source seeding
- Created [[Daily AI Agency Digest — 2026-05-24]].

## [2026-05-24] lint | Sunday maintenance check
- Checked duplicate page names, broken wikilinks, orphan pages, tag taxonomy, JSONL validity, and page size.
- Result after fixes: 0 broken wikilinks, 0 orphan content pages, 0 invalid tags, valid `/sources/sources.jsonl`.
- Known benign duplicate: root `README.md` and `raw/README.md` share the same filename but serve different folder scopes.
- `blogwatcher-cli` was unavailable in the runtime, so feed-based scanning was skipped; web/source discovery proceeded through direct web checks and curated source verification.
