## [2026-05-23] create | AI Agency Knowledgebase initialized
- Created Markdown/Git wiki structure for Superagency-style AI agency research.
- Seeded core idea, domain, argument, use-case, source-library, framework, and open-question pages.

## [2026-05-23] update | Knowledgebase tool comparison seeded
- Expanded [[Knowledgebase Tool Comparison]] with initial architecture recommendation, app tradeoffs, RAG/search options, and contrarian risks.
- Current default: keep Markdown/Git as source of truth; add Wiki.js, Obsidian/Logseq, or lightweight semantic search only when the pain justifies the service.

## [2026-05-24] update | First display-mode daily digest and source seeding
- Created [[Daily AI Agency Digest — 2026-05-24]].
- Added 12 accepted source records to `/sources/sources.jsonl`.
- Created durable pages [[Agentic Workflow Patterns]], [[AI as Normal Technology]], [[Co-Intelligence]], [[The Turing Trap]], [[Task-Level AI Adoption]], [[AI Tutor Evaluation Checklist]], and [[Compute and Agency]].
- Updated [[AI as Copilot]], [[Responsible Deployment]], [[Superagency]], [[Education]], [[Work]], [[Home Server AI Agents]], [[Strongest AI Risk Arguments]], [[AI Tutors]], and [[Balanced Governance]].
- Updated source libraries [[Articles]], [[Books]], [[Papers]], and [[Reports]].
- Added latest-run navigation to [[AI Agency Knowledgebase]].

## [2026-05-24] lint | Sunday maintenance check
- Checked duplicate page names, broken wikilinks, orphan pages, tag taxonomy, JSONL validity, and page size.
- Result after fixes: 0 broken wikilinks, 0 orphan content pages, 0 invalid tags, valid `/sources/sources.jsonl`.
- Known benign duplicate: root `README.md` and `raw/README.md` share the same filename but serve different folder scopes.
- `blogwatcher-cli` was unavailable in the runtime, so feed-based scanning was skipped; web/source discovery proceeded through direct web checks and curated source verification.

## [2026-05-24] update | Expanded daily digest with field-evidence and frontier-firm sources
- Added 12 accepted source records to `/sources/sources.jsonl` after direct web/PDF verification.
- Created [[Frontier Firm]] and [[AI Field Experiment Evidence]].
- Updated [[Work]], [[Future of Work]], [[Education]], [[AI Coding Agents]], [[Agentic Workflow Patterns]], and [[AI Use Case Evaluation Rubric]] with field-study, tutoring, coding-agent, and workflow evidence.
- Updated [[Reports]], [[Papers]], [[Articles]], [[Home]], and [[Daily AI Agency Digest — 2026-05-24]].
- Research scout subagents timed out during web discovery; manual direct search and URL verification completed the source pass.

## [2026-05-26] update | Daily AI agency curator run
- Created [[Daily AI Agency Digest — 2026-05-26]].
- Added 8 accepted source records to `/sources/sources.jsonl` after direct web verification.
- Created [[Agentic Convergence Trap]] as a new core idea page.
- Updated [[Work]] — added MIT Tech Review labor data, HBR manager bottleneck, and manufacturing augmentation patterns.
- Updated [[AI Coding Agents]] — added Nolan Lawson slow-quality coding approach and multi-model review technique.
- Updated [[Human Agency]] — added evidence-based transition framing, data infrastructure needs, and agentic convergence as agency-loss risk.
- Updated [[Agentic Workflow Patterns]] — added multi-model independent review pattern and manager-of-managers workflow.
- Updated [[Balanced Governance]] — added Stanford AI Index 2026 responsible-AI gap data and agentic convergence governance needs.
- Updated [[Optimism Without Naivety]] — added data-driven labor market framing, Stanford jagged frontier, and Doctorow bubble perspective.
- Updated [[AI Agency Knowledgebase]] navigation.
- Noted: `blogwatcher-cli` was not available in the runtime; web-based source discovery via direct URL fetching completed the source pass.
- Created [[Daily AI Agency Digest — 2026-05-25]].
- Added 14 accepted source records to `/sources/sources.jsonl` after direct web/PDF verification; `blogwatcher-cli` was unavailable, so feed scanning was skipped.
- Created [[Positive Alignment]] and [[Human Review Checkpoints]].
- Updated [[Human Agency]], [[Responsible Deployment]], [[Education]], [[Work]], [[AI for School Districts]], [[Agentic Workflow Patterns]], [[Balanced Governance]], and [[Strongest AI Risk Arguments]].
- Updated source libraries [[Articles]], [[Papers]], [[Reports]], and navigation in [[AI Agency Knowledgebase]].
- Noted access issues for some candidate pages (for example McKinsey/ScienceDirect/Medium); skipped inaccessible candidates unless enough verified metadata/content was available elsewhere.
